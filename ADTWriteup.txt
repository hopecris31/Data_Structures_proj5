For my Pagelist holder, I initially considered using a linked list or a stack.
I thought a linked list might be a good idea because adding and removing could
be done in constant time. However, this benefit would not be needed, as I would not
need to remove elements from the Pagelist.  A stack was unnecessary because it is a
complex solution for a very simple problem; I would not need to pop and return the most
recently added element.  So, I decided to go with an array.  While linked list may have
quick add and remove times, it takes linear time to search for an element.  Array search time
is linear as well, so linked list provided no additional benefit here.  I figured that
I could just add to an array in constant time if I just always added to the index size-1.
With all of these benefits and runtimes considered, the array was the best structure for the job
because it is simple and has few strings attached.  It is a built-in data type and iterating
through it is simple, as well as implementation.
